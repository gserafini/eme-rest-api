REST API endpoints for Events Made Easy plugin - CRUD operations for events, locations, categories, and recurring events.

## Description

A WordPress plugin that adds REST API endpoints to the [Events Made Easy](https://github.com/liedekef/events-made-easy) plugin.

Events Made Easy (EME) uses custom database tables instead of WordPress custom
post types, so it doesn't expose events via the WordPress REST API by default.
This plugin bridges that gap by providing a clean REST API interface to EME's
functionality.

## Features

* ‚úÖ Full CRUD operations for events (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* üìç Location management
* üè∑Ô∏è Category management
* üîÑ Recurring events support
* üîê WordPress application password authentication
* üìù Standard REST API conventions
* üåê WordPress Multisite compatible

## Requirements

* WordPress 5.0 or higher
* PHP 7.2 or higher
* Events Made Easy plugin 2.0+ installed and activated

## Installation

### Method 1: From GitHub Release

1. Download the latest `eme-rest-api.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/gserafini/eme-rest-api/releases)
2. In WordPress admin, go to Plugins ‚Üí Add New ‚Üí Upload Plugin
3. Choose the ZIP file and click "Install Now"
4. Activate the plugin
5. Ensure Events Made Easy is also installed and activated

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Upload the `eme-rest-api` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Ensure Events Made Easy is installed and activated

### Multisite Installation

The plugin works seamlessly with WordPress Multisite:

* **Network Activate:** Activates for all sites in the network
* **Per-Site Activate:** Can be activated individually per site
* **Table Prefixes:** Automatically handles site-specific table prefixes
* **REST API:** Each site has its own `/wp-json/eme/v1/` endpoints
* **Credentials:** Use application passwords from each site's admin

Example multisite usage:

```bash
# Site 1
curl https://site1.example.com/wp-json/eme/v1/eme_events \
  -u "site1admin:site1_app_password"

# Site 2
curl https://site2.example.com/wp-json/eme/v1/eme_events \

## Authentication

Use WordPress Application Passwords for authentication:

1. In WordPress admin, go to Users ‚Üí Profile
2. Scroll to "Application Passwords"
3. Create a new application password
4. Use it with your username in API requests

Example:

```bash
curl https://yoursite.com/wp-json/eme/v1/eme_events \
  -u "username:application_password"
```

## Why `eme_` Prefix?

Endpoints use the `eme_` prefix to avoid conflicts with Events Made Easy's custom post types. This ensures the REST API routes take precedence over WordPress's default post type routing.

## Development

### File Structure

```text
eme-rest-api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eme-rest-api.php    # Main plugin file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.txt          # WordPress.org format
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

### Building

To create a distribution ZIP:

```bash
./create-zip.sh
```

This creates `eme-rest-api.zip` with only the essential plugin files.
